Generate thousands of contacts to fill your device or simulator for testing/demo purposes. Generates contacts using the top 1000 male/female names mixed with the top 1000 last names for the US. Also creates home/work emails, phone numbers, and profile photos using CC licenses Flickr photos.

Currently lacking in documentation and diversity of contacts but still a work-in-progress. Feel free to submit pull-requests to improve in any way.
